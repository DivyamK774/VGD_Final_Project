# VGD Final Project: Ghost Rush
This game, ghost rush, is about escaping a big haunted mansion while jumping on solid coffins. There is also a main enemy, the ghost, who follows you and trys to kill you. In ghost rush, you will find a creepy haunted house with many coffins to add to the theme. Your character, a scared child with a flashlight is trying to escape this nightmare, while escaping a horrifying ghost. This game also includes two levels, with an inside scene and an outside scene.

To play ghost rush, use the space bar to jump, and the left and right arrow keys or keys A and D to move forward or backward respectively. You will jump onto the coffins to traverse the level, and reach the right side door to escape. If you get caught by the ghost or fall down the pit, you will lose the game, but you can reset by clicking the blue reset button.

The first of the two scripts I made was for the reset button, to be able to click on it and reset to the first scene. I made it so that you didn't have to wait for the game to reload to just reset. My second script was for my enemy, the ghost, so that it chases you around at a scpecific speed. I added this so that the player has a harder time getting to the and to make the game more fun compared to just having the endless pit be your only way to lose. I made this script with the help of an online tutorial.
